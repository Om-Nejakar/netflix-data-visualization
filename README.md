# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description
This project is an exploratory data analysis of a Netflix content dataset. The analysis uses Python libraries such as pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data and create visualizations that reveal key insights into the streaming platform's content library.

## Key Insights
* **Content Distribution**: The project compares the number of movies versus TV shows, showing which content type dominates the library.
* **Growth Over Time**: A timeline of content additions shows the yearly growth trend of Netflix's library.
* **Top Contributors**: The analysis identifies the top 10 countries and genres with the most content.
